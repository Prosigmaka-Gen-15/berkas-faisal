              The AirPods Max are over-ear headphones that are different from
              most of the others. They use stainless steel and aluminum
              materials for the build, making them a bit heavier than some of
              their biggest competitors from Sony and Bose. They also use
              removable ear cups with mesh material.
              <br />
              <br />
              Available in Silver, Space Gray, Sky Blue, Green, and Pink, these
              headphones have a Digital Crown for controlling the audio, a
              Lightning port, and a Smart Case to put them in low-power mode
              since they donâ€™t have an on/off button. The AirPods Max has up to
              20 hours of listening time on a single charge with Active Noise
              Cancellation or Transparency mode enabled. Five minutes of charge
              time provides around 1.5 hours of listening time.
